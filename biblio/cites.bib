	Abstract      = {The choice of approximate posterior distribution is one of the core problems
	in variational inference. Most applications of variational inference employ
	simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efficient
	inference, focusing on mean-field or other simple structured approximations.
	This restriction has a significant impact on the quality of inferences made
	using variational methods. We introduce a new approach for specifying flexible,
	arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our
	approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow,
	whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by
	applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of
	complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop
	categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of
	approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that
	the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true
	posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches,
	provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational
	inference.},
